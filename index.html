            Hello! Welcome to my personal website. Here you can learn more about me, my portfolio, where you can learn more about my experiences, resume, projects, and service. This website was written by me using HTML and CSS. 
            There is even a toggle button in the top right corner that allows you to see this website in a different CSS style.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a junior (c/o '24) Computer Science major and Statistics minor at Texas A&M University, but I was born and raised in Sugar Land, Texas, which is located in the greater Houston area. 
            I attended Clements High School and graduated in 2020 during the pandemic. It was actually during this time where I heavily considered my options as a future undergrad student and decided to pursue Mechanical Engineering. 
            However, during my freshman year in college, I decided that programming is where my passions lie and changed my academic path to pursue Computer Science instead. This was one of the best decisions I've made in my life.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, here I am starting my third year in the major and have already accomplished many things I never could have dreamed of. I recently completed my Summer internship with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise 
            as a Software Developer Intern, which you can read more about in the porfolio tab, and I am both the president of Aggie Women in Computer Science (AWICS) and a member of the Society of Women Engineers 
            (SWE) organizations here at Texas A&M. I also like to help my community in both the College Station and Sugar Land areas, which you can learn more about in the service tab.

            <h4> Things I Like To Do/Hobbies </h4>
            * Music is a big passion of mine, I have been in choir and played piano for most of my life, and recently I've picked up the bass guitar. I also listen to a lot of music. Check out my Spotify!
            <br>
            * I try to travel as often as I can. Of course, as a student this can be difficult, but whenever I get the chance I love to visit new places and try out new things. Earlier this year, I went to Washington D.C. with a couple friends!
            <br>
            * I am a huge cinephile and love to watch and review any type of movie. My favorite genre, however, is definitely psychological thrillers. Check out my Letterboxd!
            <br> 
            * During the pandemic, I picked up cake decorating.
            <br>
            * I figure skated for 5 years.
