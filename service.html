            <h4> Volunteering </h4>
            With the heavy coursework and student organizational responsibilities I have now, it has become significantly more difficult for me to make time for helping my community. Nonetheless, I try to do what I can 
            and participate in Big Event, which is "the largest one-day, student-run service project in the nation" according to the website here, every year. I also mentor and help girls from K-12 through my participation 
            in Aggie Women in Computer Science and Society of Women Engineers to pursue STEM-related careers through STEMfest, High School Conference, and Big/Little programs in both organizations.

            During my time in high school, on the other hand, I was much more involved in supporting my community. In fact, I was an officer of the our high schools Rotary Interact chapter, where we would have fundraisers 
            and food drives where we would raise money and resources for those undeserved in the Sugar Land and neighboring areas. I also would arrange a capella groups with other members of my high school choir (which I was 
            President of) to sing love songs to seniors at senior homes on Valentine's Day. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of school-organized service, I also volunteered at my local hospital one Summer where I accumulated over 61 hours of volunteer work in the Childbirth center. One of my favorite community service work I've done, 
            however, is when I go on Saturday mornings to my local Persian community center, Bonyad, to make meals for the homeless population in the West Houston area. Of course, this has become difficult with university being back 
            in person and an hour and a half away, but to this day I still try and go whenever I can.

                <h4> Aid Agencies I Support </h4>
                One of my favorite aid and relief organizations that I support is Islamic Relief USA (IRUSA) which is an international aid agency that provides relief and aid to over 40 countries in the world, regardless of religion, political beliefs, nor race, 
                contrary to popular belief. You can learn more about them on their website here.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another agency that I strongly believe in its core values is Rotary. Like I mentioned earlier, I was an officer for the Clements High School Chapter of Rotary's service club for students known as Rotary Interact. 
                Through my experience in Rotary Interact, I can say with confidence that Rotary truly believes in taking action on the world's most pressing issues, and the organization's emphasis on helping one another is what 
                makes it stand out amongst other aid and relief organizations to me. You can learn more about them on their website here.
